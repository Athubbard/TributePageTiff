        <p>One of the reasons Tiffany was my favorite was because she was from the midwest just like me. She is from Chicago, Illinois and a lot fo my family that watched the show as well thought that we acted similiar. Also because she was real and true and had some moreals and respectful for herself all while still being a a True Bad Girl. She later went on after the Show to do a host of things, such as modeling and acting as well as starting a nonprofit for young women.</p>
