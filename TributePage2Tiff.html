        <p>One of the reasons Tiffany was my favorite was because she was from the midwest just like me. She is from Chicago, Illinois and a lot of my family that watched the show as well, thought that we acted similiar. Also because she was real and had morals and was self-respecting all while still being a True Bad Girl. She later went on after the Show to do a host of things, such as modeling and acting as well as starting a nonprofit for young women called From A Bad Girl 2 A great Woman.</p>
